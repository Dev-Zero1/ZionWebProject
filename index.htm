      <dd>Lockwood Folly Inlet is a nearby inlet connecting the Atlantic 
      Ocean to the Intracoastal Waterway and was once the mouth of the 
      Lockwood Folly River prior to construction of the Intracoastal and 
      natural sand shifting. The inlet separates the barrier islands of 
      Oak Island and Holden Beach Isle. There are two folklore stories 
      that explain the genesis of the name "Lockwood Folly". 
      The first states that a man by the name of Lockwood began building 
      the "boat of his dreams" along the banks of the river.
