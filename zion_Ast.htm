        <p>Volcom Entertainment, officially founded in 1995, in Newport 
        Beach, California, and currently based in Costa Mesa, CA is 
        the brainchild of Volcom founder Richard Woolcott and theLINE's 
        singer/guitarist Ryan Immegart. Ryan being Volcom's first 
        sponsored snowboarder and having a love for music provided the 
        necessary components to launch the label through Volcom.

        <p>Mingo Central Comprehensive High School is a consolidated 
        high school serving central and southern Mingo County, West 
        Virginia. It is the consolidated result of high schools in 
        Delbarton, Gilbert, Matewan and Williamson. It was designed 
        by Williamson Shriver Architects, Inc. of Charleston. The school

        donated by Nicewonder Contracting Inc.

        <p>Pave Tack is a large installation, with the pod alone 
        weighing some 629 kg (1,385 lb) and measuring 4,220 mm 
        (166 inches) in length. On the F-4, the size of the pod meant 
        that it had to be carried on the centerline station in place of 
        the standard drop tank, and it imposed a substantial aerodynamic 
        drag penalty; crews referred to it as "Pave Drag," and it 
        was generally unpopular.

        <p>The film was directed by Robert Day from a screenplay by 
        Vivian Cox, John Warren and Len Heath, with additional dialogue 
        by Alan Hackney. The film boasts a rich cast of characters 
        played by, among others, Peter Sellers, Wilfrid Hyde-White, 
        Lionel Jeffries and Bernard Cribbins. Three prisoners nearing 
        the end of their jail sentences; 'Dodger' Lane, 'Jelly' Knight 
        and 'Lennie the Dip', are visited by a vicar seeking to find 
        employment for them.

        <p>In the next several years the label continued to grow through 
        traditional and nontraditional record retail, launching bands such 
        as CKY, Vaux, and Pepper. A 100% owned subsidiary of Volcom, 
        some of their best-known artists today include Pepper, Valient 
        Thorr, Riverboat Gamblers, Year Long Disaster and Guttermouth. 
        Volcom Ent. produced the "Volcom Stage" on the Vans Warped Tour 
        for 10 years and in 2007 began their own annual international 
        tour, simply called "The Volcom Tour".
