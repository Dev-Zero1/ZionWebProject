        <h1>Steamship Experiments on the Potomac River</h1>
        
        <p>With the assistance of Dodger's girlfriend Ethel and 
        Lennie's mum, they smuggle themselves out in a prison van. The 
        operation is almost foiled by the disciplinarian 'Sour' Crout, 
        the new Chief Prison Officer who is replacing the easy-going 
        retiring Jenkins. The diamond heist goes like clockwork and the 
        three break back into prison, hiding the proceeds in the 
        Governor's office.
        </p>
        <p>The prison scenes were filmed at the West Cavalry Barracks at 
         Aldershot, and the security van robbery at Pirbright Arch in the
         village of Brookwood in Surrey. The film was the fourth most 
         popular movie at the British box office in 1960. 
         Zigzo (stylized as ZIGZO) is a Japanese rock supergroup 
         that originally started activities in 1999 and 
         disbanded in 2002.

        <p>The Republic of Korea Air Force (RoKAF) ordered an initial 
         batch of eight pods in 1984 for delivery in 1987. It may have 
         subsequently obtained additional pods from USAF surplus. The 
         RoKAF uses the pods on its F-4 Phantoms. The age of the Pave 
         Tack system has made for a maintenance and reliability 
         headache, since many of its parts are obsolete and no longer 
         available.
        </p>
        <p>About 150 AVQ-26 pods were built, substantially less 
        than originally planned. The last USAF Pave Tacks were 
        withdrawn with the retirement of the F-111 in 1996. 
        The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) purchased ten Pave Tack 
        pods in 1980 for its F-111 fleet. All 24 F-111Cs were wired 
        for the pod, although there were not enough pods for all to be 
        simultaneously equipped.

        <p>Marc Kern (born April 28, 1989) is a Swiss ice hockey 
        goaltender. He is currently playing with the SC Langenthal of 
        the National League B. The Ford Aerospace AN/AVQ-26 Pave Tack's 
        an electro-optical targeting pod developed by the United States 
        Air Force (USAF) for military attack aircraft. It uses a laser 
        and a forward looking infrared to find and designate targets for 
        laser-guided bombs and other precision-guided munitions.
